# Predicting Beer Prediction

**Objective**
This project aims to analyze and forecast 38 years of monthly beer production data (from January 1956 to December 1993) for the Australian brewing industry. Using advanced time series analysis techniques, the project seeks to provide actionable insights and reliable forecasts to aid in production planning and resource allocation.

**Methodology**
**Data Analysis**
Data Preparation: Cleaned, preprocessed, and transformed historical beer production data to make it suitable for time series modeling.

Exploratory Analysis: Conducted a comprehensive analysis to understand trends and patterns in the data.

**Model Development**
ARIMA Modeling: Developed and evaluated two ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models to predict future beer production trends.

Model Accuracy: Assessed models using Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Achieved MAE values of 7.14 (12% deviation) and 8.99 (15% deviation), demonstrating robust predictive capability.

**Insights and Recommendations**
Forecast Accuracy: Achieved a high accuracy rate of approximately 92%.

Production Planning: Enhanced planning efficiency by predicting future production levels.

Resource Allocation: Optimized resource allocation by anticipating demand fluctuations and production needs.

Decision Support: Provided insights for optimizing production processes and responding to market dynamics.

**Techniques Used**
ARIMA Modeling: Utilized for capturing time series patterns and making accurate predictions based on historical data.

Time Series Analysis: Applied to uncover trends, seasonal variations, and patterns in beer production data.

**Impact and Benefits**
Improved Forecast Accuracy: Enabled stakeholders to make informed decisions based on reliable forecasts.

Enhanced Production Planning: Improved inventory management and operational strategy.

Optimized Resource Allocation: Facilitated better resource management and planning.
